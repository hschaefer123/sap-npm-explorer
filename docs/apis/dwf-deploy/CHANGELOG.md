## [2.2.0] - 2017-05-30
### Added
- .dwfnamespace - schema validation

- trace - removes the sensitive information for the traced data
- dwf-template - adds the dependencies that are required by the Backend module of our dwf-template
- ssl certificate - loads the certificate by calling xsenv.loadCertificates(). If no certificates are loaded, then falls back to process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = 0 to avoid rejecting unauthorized backends

## [2.0.0] - 2017-02-23
### Added
- dwf module environment - isolation per version, currently used for version 1

- command line arguments - help, version, trace, verbose, exit and rejectUnauthorized
- .dwftaskchain - batch post for all task chains will replace the old post per task chain, to ensure the deployment transaction of module level
- .txt - the design time artifact for modeling text, where the content of the file can be any valid text
- .{any extension} - rejects the deployment of dwf-modules, which contain unsupported file extensions
 - .dwftaskchain - the design time artifact for modeling task chains, where the content of the file shall be a valid stringified json

### Fixed
- empty dwf module - Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined: \@sap\dwf-deploy\lib\dwf\repository.js:35
- .dwftaskchain - supports nameless designtime files (i.e. .dwftaskchain as a complete file name)
- service instance - logs the name of the service instance (a.k.a. container) to which is deploying
- environment - expects the finalized structure for DWF 2.0 SP00 and HANA 2 SP01
- the stack trace of an error - will not be lost, but will be traced
- .dwftaskchain - will check the status code in the response of the post http call
- .dwftaskchain - will abort the deployment, when two or more designtime files defining the same runtime object
- .dwftaskchain - the default namespace of the runtime object is now prefixed with {mta.yaml mta name}.{mta.yaml dwf-module name}
 - .dwftaskchain - the name of the runtime object is derived by the file name, but without its file extension
